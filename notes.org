* Running debug console
qdbus org.kde.plasmashell /PlasmaShell org.kde.PlasmaShell.showInteractiveKWinConsole
* Installing script
~kpackagetool5 -i .~
* Updating a script
~kpackagetool5 -u .~
* TODO Issues [1/6]
- [X] +plasmapkg2/kpackagetoo5 behave inconsistently: try to install/uninstall
  and you will see+ kpackagetool5 seems the way to go.
- [ ] the kde knowledge base gives the wrong debug console command
- [ ] console is undocumented
- [ ] console is awkward to use... how to reload? import files?
- [ ] The applications to toggle should be configurable
- [ ] The script should start the applications if they do not run (not clear how
  to do that in a kwinscript)
