* Running debug console
qdbus org.kde.plasmashell /PlasmaShell org.kde.PlasmaShell.showInteractiveKWinConsole
* Installing script
plasmapkg2 -t kwinscript -i . 

or maybe 

kpackagetool5 -t kwinscript -i .
* Updating a script
* TODO Steps to us kotlin.js
- [ ] Try to generate a single-file script (with gradle)
  - [ ] external definitions of kwin objects
  - [ ] adapt gradle assemble step
- [ ] See what happens with multi-module projects.. probably it breaks single
  file compilation.
- [ ] Convert to a "declarativescript" (see kwin-tiling project sources) and see
  if Qt.import is dirty enough to import multiple modules
- [ ] Try to extends kotlins packaging (there are already several modes)
* TODO Issues [0/4]
- [ ] plasmapkg2/kpackagetoo5 behave inconsistently: try to install/uninstall
  and you will see
- [ ] the kde knowledge base gives the wrong debug console command
- [ ] console is undocumented
- [ ] console is awkward to use... how to reload? import files?
